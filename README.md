## Route planner for a road network

Shortest path with **NetworkX's** shortest_path() function. Here, this function used **Dijkstra's** algorithm. This algorithm has a wide variety of applications, for example in network routing protocols.

You need **Smopy** for this recipe. You can install it with pip install git+https://github.com/rossant/smopy. In order for NetworkX to read Shapefile datasets, you also need **GDAL/OGR**.
